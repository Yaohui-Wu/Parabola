* This is a cipher algorithm which uses the "JunTai(like Shuffle)" distribution random number algorithm and a secret keys table to encrypt and decrypt.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution random number algorithm refers to: each number (integer or real number) is distributed disorderly on the number axis, its value appears only once without repetition.
* The secret keys in the secret keys table are not limited to 8 bytes, they can be more than 8 bytes.
* From small to big, and from big to small. That's why it's named parabola.

* It's just a demo version, the official version includes lower version, intermediate version and advanced version.
* If you want to source code of official version, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack this algorithm one day in my lifetime.
* If you break this algorithm, please let me know. Thank you very so much!

* Compiled on MacOS, Linux and *BSD in X86_64 platform.
